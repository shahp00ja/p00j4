### Hi there üëã
I'm Pooja, an automation nerd and open source enthusiast. I love brainstorming and implementing crazy ideas to figure out ways to improve the product quality. Having a blend of dev, qa & devops mindset, I strives to bridge the gaps between all the teams to attain the best results.
Driven by curiosity to learn & share new things every day, I pen them, open-source, record tutorials and talk about them at open conferences, some of the glimpses can be found here:
